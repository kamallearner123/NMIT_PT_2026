## <a name="hr"></a>1. Behavioral & HR Questions

> **Tip:** Use the **STAR Method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for answering situations.

1.  **Tell me about yourself.**
    -   *Focus:* Education, Skills, Projects, and why you are here. Keep it under 2 minutes.
2.  **What are your strengths and weaknesses?**
    -   *Strength:* Adaptable, Fast Learner (give example).
    -   *Weakness:* Public speaking (but mention how you are improving it).
3.  **Why do you want to join this company?**
    -   *Focus:* Company culture, technology stack, growth opportunities.
4.  **Describe a time you faced a challenge.**
    -   *STAR:* "During my project X, we faced Y. I did Z. Result was Success."

## <a name="cpp"></a>2. C/C++ & Programming

5.  **Difference between C and C++?**
    -   C is procedural; C++ is Object-Oriented. C++ supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism.
6.  **What are Pointers?**
    -   Variables that store the memory address of another variable.
7.  **Difference between `malloc` and `new`?**
    -   `malloc`: Function, returns `void*`, manual size calc.
    -   `new`: Operator, returns correct type, calls constructor.
8.  **Explain `static` keyword.**
    -   In functions: Retains value between calls.
    -   In class: Shared by all objects.
9.  **Memory Leak?**
    -   Allocated memory that is not freed. Fix: `free()` or `delete`.

## <a name="dsa"></a>3. Data Structures & Algorithms

10. **Array vs Linked List?**
    -   Array: Contiguous, O(1) access, Fixed size.
    -   List: Non-contiguous, O(n) access, Dynamic size.
11. **Stack vs Queue?**
    -   Stack: LIFO (Last In First Out). Push/Pop.
    -   Queue: FIFO (First In First Out). Enqueue/Dequeue.
12. **Time Complexity of Binary Search?**
    -   O(log n). (Input must be sorted).
13. **Difference between BFS and DFS?**
    -   BFS (Breadth-First): Uses Queue. Level by level. Shortest path.
    -   DFS (Depth-First): Uses Stack/Recursion. Deep dive. Backtracking.
14. **What is a Hash Map?**
    -   Key-Value store. Average O(1) access. Handles collisions (Chaining/Probing).

## <a name="dbms"></a>4. DBMS & SQL

15. **DBMS vs RDBMS?**
    -   RDBMS stores data in tables and enforces constraints (FK/PK).
16. **Explain Normalization.**
    -   Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy. (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
17. **Types of Joins?**
    -   Inner, Left, Right, Full.
18. **ACID Properties?**
    -   Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
19. **Primary Key vs Unique Key?**
    -   PK: Unique + Not Null (Only 1 per table).
    -   Unique: Unique + Can be Null (Multiple per table).
20. **DELETE vs TRUNCATE?**
    -   DELETE: DML (slower, rollback possible).
    -   TRUNCATE: DDL (faster, no rollback).

## <a name="os"></a>5. Operating Systems

21. **Process vs Thread?**
    -   Process: Separate memory, heavy.
    -   Thread: Shared memory, lightweight.
22. **What is Deadlock?**
    -   4 conditions: Mutual Exclusion, Hold & Wait, No Preemption, Circular Wait.
23. **Virtual Memory?**
    -   Using disk as extension of RAM. Paging.
24. **Context Switching?**
    -   Saving state of current process and loading next one.
25. **Semaphore vs Mutex?**
    -   Mutex: Locking (Ownership).
    -   Semaphore: Signaling (Count).

## <a name="system"></a>6. System Design & Networking

26. **OSI Model Layers?**
    -   Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.
27. **TCP vs UDP?**
    -   TCP: Reliable, Connection-oriented.
    -   UDP: Fast, Connectionless.
28. **What happens when you type a URL?**
    -   DNS -> IP -> TCP Handshake -> HTTP Request -> Render.
29. **What is a Load Balancer?**
    -   Distributes traffic across servers.
30. **CAP Theorem?**
    -   Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance (Pick 2).

## <a name="cloud"></a>7. Cloud & DevOps

31. **IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS?**
    -   IaaS: Infrastructure (AWS EC2).
    -   PaaS: Platform (Heroku).
    -   SaaS: Software (Gmail).
32. **What is Docker?**
    -   Platform for containerization (OS-level virtualization).
33. **What is CI/CD?**
    -   Continuous Integration (Build/Test).
    -   Continuous Deployment (Release).
